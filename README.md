## 📋 Project Overview

"Nick's Big Day" is an interactive web-based puzzle game designed specifically for Nick's 38th birthday. The game features 38 unique puzzles of increasing complexity that must be solved sequentially to unlock a final surprise gift. The first puzzle is a space station assembly challenge where players must correctly position different modules to create a functional space station.

### 🎯 Purpose & Goals

- Create an engaging, interactive birthday experience
- Present 38 different puzzles (one for each year)
- Focus on tactile, hands-on interactions rather than abstract logic
- Build something that works across devices (desktop and mobile)
- Lead to a tangible gift reveal at the end of the experience

## 🧩 Puzzle Implementation

Each puzzle follows a consistent structure:

1. **HTML**: Defines the puzzle layout and elements
2. **CSS**: Styles specific to the puzzle
3. **JavaScript**: Logic for interactivity and completion checking

### Core Features

- **Progress Tracking**: Completed puzzles are saved in localStorage
- **Hint System**: Each puzzle includes a hint button for assistance
- **Navigation**: Users can return to the main menu at any time
- **Adaptive Design**: Puzzles work on both desktop and mobile devices
- **Touch Support**: All interactions work with touch screens

### Adding New Puzzles

Each puzzle directory should follow this structure:

```
puzzles/puzzleX/
├── index.html  # Puzzle layout and structure
├── style.css   # Puzzle-specific styles
└── script.js   # Puzzle logic and interactivity
```

To implement a new puzzle:
1. Create a new directory under `puzzles/`
2. Copy the template files from an existing puzzle
3. Modify the HTML, CSS, and JS to implement your puzzle
4. Update the puzzle configuration in `script.js`
5. Reference the global utilities from `main.js` for progress tracking

## 🎮 Puzzle Types

We've organized the 38 puzzles into categories based on interaction style:

1. **🧩 Assembly Puzzles** (Puzzles 1, 11, 21, 31)
   - Drag-and-drop components into correct positions
   - Example: Space Station Assembly

2. **🚀 Physics/Motion Puzzles** (Puzzles 2, 12, 22, 32)
   - Involve trajectory, timing, and motion
   - Example: Launch trajectory challenge

3. **👾 Pattern Matching** (Puzzles 3, 13, 23, 33)
   - Match symbols, colors, or sequences
   - Example: Alien symbol decoder

4. **🛸 Spatial Arrangement** (Puzzles 4, 14, 24, 34)
   - Arrange objects to fit constraints
   - Example: Tetris-style cargo loading

5. **🔮 Visual Discovery** (Puzzles 5, 15, 25, 35)
   - Find hidden elements or patterns
   - Example: Star constellation alignment

6. **⭐ Memory/Sequence** (Puzzles 6, 16, 26, 36)
